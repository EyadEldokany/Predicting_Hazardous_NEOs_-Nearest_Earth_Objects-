# Predicting_Hazardous_NEOs_-Nearest_Earth_Objects-
I have trained a model to predict Hazardous NEOs (Nearest Earth Objects)
# First
I have cleared the null values in the dataset
# Second 
I visualized the data using some graphs to make it easy to read
# Third
I started training the model using Random Forest model
